Hi! My name is Astra, and welcome to my blog! I'm currently a computer science
PhD student at Texas A&M University, advised by
[Dr. Vivek Sarin](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/sarin/index.html). My doctoral
research focuses on scalable and efficient Gaussian Process (GP) regression,
and you are welcomed to check out
[this post]({% post_url 2023-08-26-research %}) to learn more about my research
contributions.

I grew up in Beijing, China, and obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical
and Computer Engineering at Beihang University (formerly BUAA) in the same
city. The multicultural nature of my education and perosnal background has
shaped my unique perspective towards problem-solving, social interaction, and
career pursuits. As a result, my interests span across a wide range of topics,
and I'm able to learn new things very fast.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies and TV shows, fiddling with
smart-home gadgets, and knitting/crocheting. And in terms of the future, I'm a
firm believer in the revolution of AI and electronic vehicles.

Everyone says I look like a little squirrel, so here's an image of a cute one:
