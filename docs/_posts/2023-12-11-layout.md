Top Level Directories
---------------------

- **`include`**: contains public API header files (.h or .hpp), often organized
  to mirror the structure of **`src`**, shouldn’t be used if using merged header
  placement
- **`src`**: contains source files (.cpp), subdirectories may be used to group
  related source files
- **`tests`**: for unit tests, often using frameworks like Google Test
- **`libs` or `external`**: third-party libraries or external dependencies
- **`build`**: build artifacts, not checked into version control
- **`docs`**: any code documentation
- **`examples` or `samples`**: example applications or usage samples
- **`scripts`**: utility scripts, like build or deployment scripts
- **CMakeLists.txt or Makefile**: used for compilation
- **README, LICENSE, and .gitignore Files**: project description, licensing
  information, and Git configurations

Header File Placement
---------------------

There are typically two methods of placing headers in a library, namely
separated or merged header placement
[[1]](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?force=1&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork/develop/data/spec.bs).

### public and private header

Public headers are intended to be included by users of the library or
application. They define public interface of the library, including classes,
functions, and types that external code can use. Public headers go into the
`include` directory, made available to other projects that depend on the
library.

Private headers are used internally within the library or application and are
not meant to be exposed to its users. They contain implementation details,
internal data structures, and helper functions that are specific to the
library's internal workings. Private headers are placed within `src`, which are
only included by the source files of the library or application itself.

### separate header placement

Both `include` and `src` are used for source directories. `include` contains
public headers of the library, and `src` contains source code and private
headers. Each component’s header and source files are split between `include`
and `src`, and the relative path in both should be the same, so that each `.cpp`
file in `src` corresponds to a `.h` or `.hpp` file in `include`.

Example:

```
project_root/
│
├── include/
│   ├── mod1/
│   │   └── mod1_public.h     // Public header for mod1
│   │
│   └── mod2/
│       └── mod2_public.h     // Public header for mod2
│
├── src/
    ├── mod1/
    │   ├── mod1_private.h    // Private header for mod1
    │   └── mod1_public.cpp   // Implementation for mod1
    │
    └── mod2/
        ├── mod2_private.h    // Private header for mod2
        └── mod2_public.cpp   // Implementation for mod2
```

Users are given only the `include` directory, and libraries should be compiled
with both `include` and `src` directories.

### merged header placement

Only `src` is used.

Example:

```
project_root/
│
├── src/
    ├── mod1/
    │   ├── mod1.h            // Public and private declarations for mod1
    │   └── mod1.cpp          // Implementation for mod1
    │
    └── mod2/
        ├── mod2.h            // Public and private declarations for mod2
        └── mod2.cpp          // Implementation for mod2
```

Other Components
----------------

- **`main.cpp`**: usually in the project root directory or the root of `src`
- **subdirectories**: group related source files into subdirectories
- **tests**: source files for the tested code should have `test` in the file
  name, like `mod1.test.cpp`, put test in `tests` folder
